# Adding emotion to a .wav file using Python and the WORLD vocoder involves several steps. The WORLD vocoder is used for high-quality speech analysis and synthesis, allowing manipulation of speech features like pitch, formants, and aperiodicity, which are crucial for conveying emotion. Here's a conceptual outline and code snippet demonstrating the process: Install necessary libraries.
# Code

#     pip install pyworld numpy soundfile
# Load the audio file.
# Python

import soundfile as sf
import numpy as np
import pyworld as pw
import librosa

def load_audio(file_path):
    audio, sr = sf.read(file_path)
    audio = audio.astype(np.float64)
    return audio, sr

# Analyze the speech using WORLD.
def analyze_speech(audio, sr):
    f0, t = pw.dio(audio, sr)
    sp = pw.cheaptrick(audio, f0, t, sr)
    ap = pw.d4c(audio, f0, t, sr)

    # f0, sp, ap = pw.wav2world(audio, sr)

    return f0, sp, ap

# Modify speech features to add emotion.

def modify_features(f0, sp, ap, emotion):
    if emotion == "happy":
        f0 *= 1.2  # Increase pitch for happiness
        sp *= 1.1 # Increase spectral energy
    elif emotion == "sad":
        f0 *= 0.7  # Decrease pitch for sadness
        sp *= 0.9  # Decrease spectral energy
    elif emotion == "angry":
        f0 *= 1.4 # Increase pitch for anger
        sp *= 1.3 # Increase spectral energy
    # Add more emotion conditions as needed

    return f0, sp, ap

# Synthesize the modified speech.

def synthesize_speech(f0, sp, ap, sr):
    y = pw.synthesize(f0, sp, ap, sr)
    return y

#Save the modified audio.

def save_audio(file_path, audio, sr):
    sf.write(file_path, audio, sr)
# Main function.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    def add_emotion_to_audio(input_file, output_file, emotion):
        audio, sr = load_audio(input_file)
        f0, sp, ap = analyze_speech(audio, sr)
        f0, sp, ap = modify_features(f0, sp, ap, emotion)
        modified_audio = synthesize_speech(f0, sp, ap, sr)

        if emotion == "happy":
            cadf = 1
        elif emotion == "sad":
            cadf = 0.8
        elif emotion == "angry":
            cadf = 1.2
        modified_audio = librosa.effects.time_stretch(modified_audio, rate=cadf)

        save_audio(output_file, modified_audio, sr)
    
    # Example usage
    input_file = "vs_000.wav"
    output_file = "output_{}.wav"
    emotion = "happy"
    add_emotion_to_audio(input_file, output_file.format(emotion), emotion)
    emotion = "sad"
    add_emotion_to_audio(input_file, output_file.format(emotion), emotion)
    emotion = "angry"
    add_emotion_to_audio(input_file, output_file.format(emotion), emotion)

# This code provides a basic framework. Fine-tuning the emotion modification and handling various 
# emotional nuances may require more sophisticated signal processing techniques and potentially 
# machine learning models trained on emotional speech data.
